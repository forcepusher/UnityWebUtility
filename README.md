# UnityWebUtility  
  
This is a development repository. To install the package, use this repo instead:  
https://github.com/forcepusher/com.agava.webutility  
  
To run unit tests: in Unity, go to "Window" -> "General" -> "Test Runner".  
Make sure your target platform is set to WebGL in build settings.  
Switch to "PlayMode" and click "Run All Tests (WebGL)". It'll take a while.  
  
Before publishing a new version, rename "Samples" folder to "Samples~" and remove the meta file for the folder.

That's Unity, not the worst thing they've done so far.
